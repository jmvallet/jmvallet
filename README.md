ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jean-Marie. I like building web applications with Ruby On Rails and web standards. I am currently working at [RingCentral Engage Digital](https://www.ringcentral.com/digital-customer-engagement.html) from Valence in France as a full remote senior software engineer. I previously worked at Pertimm and more specifically on [www.viky.ai](https://www.viky.ai/) NLP platform.

I also take care of [www.aux-petits-oignons.fr](https://www.aux-petits-oignons.fr/en), a website creation platform made for independent restaurateurs.
