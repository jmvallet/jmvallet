ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jean-Marie. I like building web applications with Ruby On Rails and web standards. I am currently working at RingCentral Engage Digital from Valence in France (full remote).
I also take care of [www.aux-petits-oignons.fr](https://www.aux-petits-oignons.fr/en) , a website creation platform made for independent restaurateurs.
